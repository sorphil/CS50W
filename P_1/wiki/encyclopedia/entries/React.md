# React

React (also known as **React.js** or **bazingaJS**) is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](/entry/Javascript) library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the [DOM](/entry/DOM), so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing. React Router is an example of such a library.
